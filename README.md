# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

This is my portfolio project in which houses my most recent work as a developer.\
It makes use of flexbox and I incorporated dark mode with useContext.\
I also used it as an opportunity to try to create several different design themes.\
I will be updating the design over time.

It may be viewed live by clicking [here](https://jonathan-butler.herokuapp.com/).

It's fully responsive, so go ahead, try it in mobile, too!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
